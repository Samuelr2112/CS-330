Design Approach and Process:
When I design software, I focus on keeping things simple and modular. I like to break down tasks into smaller parts that can be reused. I think this makes it easier to manage everything. For example, I design features like camera controls or lighting so they can be tweaked without redoing the whole thing. It helps me keep the code clean and scalable.

New Design Skills Developed:
I’ve learned a lot about creating reusable components. It's all about writing code that you can plug into different parts without rewriting it every time. I’ve also improved my lighting skills, especially when balancing ambient and directional light. This helped me understand how lighting can change the way everything looks.

Design Tactics for Future Work:
Modular design is something I’ll keep using. Breaking down each part of the software into smaller, reusable functions makes future work easier. It’s efficient, and I can see myself applying this approach whenever I work on anything that requires flexibility or scalability.

Development Process:
When developing programs, I start small and build up. I always try to nail down the core functionality first, like basic controls or navigation. After that, I add more details and test everything as I go. This way, I can make sure things work together smoothly without rushing.

Iteration in Development:
I use iteration a lot. When I add a new feature, I test it out, fix issues, and make adjustments until it fits. The idea is to keep testing and improving until everything works perfectly. It helps me make sure everything flows well and works without major bugs.

Evolution of Code Development:
Over time, I’ve become better at writing code that can be reused. Early on, I focused on just getting things to work. Now, I try to make everything more efficient and easier to modify. I realized that writing scalable code from the start makes everything easier in the long run.

Role of Computer Science in Reaching Goals:
Computer science is my way of reaching my goals. It gives me the tools to build and create things I care about. I want to work in software development, and learning how to write efficient and scalable code is a big part of that.

Computational Graphics and Future Pathways:
Working with computational graphics gives me new skills in 3D environments and interactivity. This applies directly to my educational path, whether it’s game development or virtual simulations. It’s all about creating something users can interact with in real-time.

Future Professional Applications:
These skills are also important for my career. Knowing how to make interactive, optimized 3D scenes will be valuable in fields like game development or any job where visuals are a key part of the software. It opens up opportunities in industries that use graphics-heavy tech.
